## Research & Exploration

During week one I used Scratch. Scratch is a visual programming language, I experimented with to help better understand some of the fundamentals of programming.

This tool helped me experiment and understand some data science fundamentals such as variables, loops, arithmetic operations, control flow and user inputs.

Scratch uses unique templates of pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Allowing me to test and play with some more advanced coding science as well as showing me the potential programing languages have for tools and games such as the one I made in the picture above.

I found scratch very informative as it showed me how I can be in control and create games and tools from the ground up.

GitHub is a site where you can upload, edit and test code on your own or collaboratively as a team. GitHub includes Git which is a software for tracking changes in any set of files.

During one of my lectures my professor recommended we get started with the basics of GitHub early to make it easier in the future when it will undoubtedly become a useful tool.

I learned some of the basics of mark-up, a text formatting language used to write and comment on GitHub pages as well as learning other options such as HTML.

I forked my professor's GitHub repository to get an idea of how code sharing actually works as well as making my own GitHub pages where I could test some mark-up formatting and start a research depository as seen below.

After my scratch and GitHub introduction I was recommended to research and learn some of the Python programming language. This language had a lot of the same tools as Scratch does but in a more powerful less obvious syntax. I quickly learned the ease this programming language has for projects of an arithmetic nature and realised with some practice I could build code for a functioning calculator if I wished to as a practice product.

## Analysis & Evaluation

A lot of my study time has been spent practicing python below is some practice showing basic control flow and function creation in python.

Below are some practice examples of some practical inputs and calculations for conversions in python:

Some more advanced usability. Demonstrating usage of:
- Functions: sum() and len()
- The .append method 
- Lists
- Datatype conversions
- User input
- While loops
