During week one I used Scratch. Scratch is a visual programming language, I experimented with to help better understand some of the fundamentals of programming.

This tool helped me experiment and understand some data science fundamentals such as variables, loops, arithmetic operations, control flow and user inputs.

Scratch uses unique templates of pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Allowing me to test and play with some more advanced coding science as well as showing me the potential programing languages have for tools and games such as the one I made in the picture above.

I found scratch very informative as it showed me how I can be in control and create games and tools from the ground up.
