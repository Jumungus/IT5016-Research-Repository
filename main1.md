## General Research & Exploration

During week one I used Scratch. Scratch is a visual programming language, I experimented with to help better understand some of the fundamentals of programming.

This tool helped me experiment and understand some data science fundamentals such as variables, loops, arithmetic operations, control flow and user inputs.

Scratch uses unique templates of pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Allowing me to test and play with some more advanced coding science as well as showing me the potential programing languages have for tools and games such as the one I made in the picture above.

I found scratch very informative as it showed me how I can be in control and create games and tools from the ground up.

GitHub is a site where you can upload, edit and test code on your own or collaboratively as a team. GitHub includes Git which is a software for tracking changes in any set of files.

During one of my lectures my professor recommended we get started with the basics of GitHub early to make it easier in the future when it will undoubtedly become a useful tool.

I learned some of the basics of mark-up, a text formatting language used to write and comment on GitHub pages as well as learning other options such as HTML.

I forked my professor's GitHub repository to get an idea of how code sharing actually works as well as making my own GitHub pages where I could test some mark-up formatting and start a research depository as seen below.

After my scratch and GitHub introduction I was recommended to research and learn some of the Python programming language. This language had a lot of the same tools as Scratch does but in a more powerful less obvious syntax. I quickly learned the ease this programming language has for projects of an arithmetic nature and realised with some practice I could build code for a functioning calculator if I wished to as a practice product.

## Analysis & Evaluation

A lot of my study time has been spent practicing python below is some practice showing basic control flow and function creation in python.

Below are some practice examples of some practical inputs and calculations for conversions in python:

<a href="pythonexample2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yVLs1xK.png" title="pythonexample2" /></a>

Some more advanced usability. Demonstrating usage of:
- Functions: sum() and len()
- The .append method 
- Lists
- Datatype conversions
- User input
- While loops

After learning an adequate amount of python structure I realised I didn’t know how user interfaces are built and managed, I did some research and learned about Tkinter, a python module I can import which allows me to build and design custom GUIs for my code. This was important for me for most software I have ever used has come with easily intractable interfaces and helped me envision my full project. 

I had a brief Idea of a calculator project to build so I spent some time researching and creating features from Tkinter I believed would help my project such as Assigning functions to a GUI and Building and designing basic GUIs.

## Application of Knowledge & Understanding

With my new knowledge of arithmetic operations, python and Tkinter I believed I was ready to work on a project, I have some experience with designing and creating projects so I started with a paper plan and a model diagram as seen below.

<a href="papercalc1"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HvQAEdm.png" title="papercalc1" /></a>

As far as practical use, I am satisfied if the program is able to do basic arithmetic operations of two numbers including addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. These are very standard calculator operations so for the most part my GUI design resembles a standard calculator with a clear/reset and equals/sum button.

This is very useful as people intrinsically recognize the interface layout and the client will have an easy time utilizing the program. One bonus feature I added was to have an effective way to convert the length units of inches and centimetres between each other. To add this functionality to the GUI I placed two buttons under the program titled “Inches” and “cm” that would convert the entered number to the selected unit and display the converted sum respectively.

### Development of Application

For the development of this application I will be using Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code as my text editor, many options for editors would work and I only chose these two programs because of my previous practice and proficiency with them.
Im giving myself a few weeks to complete my program which is plenty of time. I will however aim to finish most of the build early to allow some freedom to test, polish and potentially fix the application as well as giving me time to update my research repository before It is due.

### Installation and Configuration of Tools To Set Up The Lab Environment

The installation and configuration of tools and software that I will be using to create this program are Python, Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. This is mostly setup on the Whitecliffe student computers already.  I imported the Python module Tkinter with from tkinter import* This line of code imports a set of pre-made functions which I can use to build graphical user interfaces like the one in the software model prototype above.  As always within an IT lab environment it is safe to expect slight issues and disruptions as I build my program however with my IT experience I am confident that I can overcome them.

I found it important to keep track of my lab environment so I can know the fundamental limitations and requirements of my software so I can replicate my environment if I ever wish to share or use it somewhere else.

### Testing Of Application

Once my program's algorithmic structure is complete I will test a list of practical commands. I will work to test as many potential use cases of my program I can find to see if they run adequately and then bug fix and redesign issues until the program is up to quality and has fully met the client’s requirements. Some of these test cases include:

Checking the arithmetic operations are working fine- +, -, /, * etc.
- Verify that hitting ‘C’ cancels any digits or operations added.
- Verify that all the buttons are present and text written on them is readable.
- Verify that the calculator gives the correct result in case of operations containing decimal numbers.
- Verify the spacing between the two buttons is uncluttered.
- Verify the number of digits allowed to enter in the calculator for any operation.
- Check if keeping the calculator unused for a certain period of time, turns it off automatically
- Verify that on pressing two operators one after the other, the latest one will override the previous operator.
- Verify the state of the calculator when two buttons are pressed simultaneously.

### Presentation of Application

With my application I will create a small instructional write up on how to use the tkinter graphical user interface effectively just in case I forget or share with someone who is unsure. I also included the lab environment specifications in case they need to be setup.

You can run this program in visual studio code or notepad++ by selecting the python file after selecting run. The final product shown below.

## My Chatbot Software Project

For my assignment I have been tasked with useing my newfound skills to build a software product. I chose some quotes from my assesment as I felt they where important points to focus on.

*"You've been researching lots of different types of code and/or various software practices and technologies. You've developed something of your own, which you think is interesting, that you're proud of, or that you have found compelling and interesting to work with. This could be called Your Software Project.*" -Whitecliffe assignment

*"We are asking you to treat your software like an artwork."*

*"based on your own technical research and emerging practice."*

*Most importantly, this will help to build your intellectual confidence as a researcher and technical acumen and a practitioner."*


I find it good when working in IT to almost redo my work once I have gained skills and experience. I am going to spend some time studying python chatbots as they can be complex generative programs that can formulate their own original responses or simple rule-based programs that give predefined responses.I find the broad task of a chatbot optimal as the programs complexibility is very flexible allowing me to relax aswell as have freedom to push myself and expand on my programing skills.
 

### My Chatbot Software Project Research & Exploration
I spent some time looking into diffrent types of chatbots and how/why they are used.

I good pratical use of chatbots are for customer support on websites. A user query could be, “Show me hotels in Christchurch for tomorrow.” and the bot will help the user find hotels.

Some chatbots are advanced virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri who can help you use technology more efficiently and naturally.

And some such as Cleverbot.com are for entertainment.

### I started by building a very simple chatbot that will just repeat a users prompt.

<a href="echobot"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JCFZGZQ.png" title="echobot" /></a>

Basic program running successfully:

<a href="echobot2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y4NaXlv.png" title="echobot2" /></a>

### Magic 8 Ball

I found a project map online for a slightly more advanced Magic 8 Ball chatbot, It uses the random module allowing for an unspecific but entertaining response for the users question. as shown below.

<a href="magic8ball"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y7UUoSp.png" title="magic8ball" /></a>

### More pratical project example

My next pratice was a program to help automatically calculate shipping costs.

I was given a set of rules for shipping costs as shown below:

<a href="shiprules"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2UpMGgo.png" title="shiprules" /></a>

My program will take a shipped product's weight and calculate the most cost efficient options for delivery.

<a href="ship2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/okFj0yH.png" title="ship2" /></a>

the code checks the price of each shipping option according to the rules and outputs all options.

<a href="ship3"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfiG4lB.png" title="ship3" /></a>

I am inspired by this completed product as I can see its obvious use and potential. Some simple advancements could be the ability to find the cheapest of the three options or even ask for the input before calculating for a more personal experience.
